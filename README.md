# Power Consumption Time Series Forecast

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to experiment with using neural networks for time series forecasting. In particular, forecasting electric power consumption in one household when given 4 years of data with a one-minute sampling rate.

### Methods Used
* DNN's
* RNN's
* Convolutional RNN's
* Callbacks: LearningRateScheduler, TensorBoard, EarlyStopping
* Moving Average Forecast

### Technologies
* Python
* TensorFlow
* TensorBoard
* jupyter
* pandas, numpy
* matplotlib

## Project Description
For this project, my goal was to learn how I could apply neural networks to time series forecasting problems. I experimented with different types of neural network architectures such as DNN's and RNN's in order to compare performance and gain a better understanding of how neural networks can be applied to time series data using TensorFlow.
